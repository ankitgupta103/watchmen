LoRa Driver Comparison: SX1262 LoRa HAT vs Core1262-868M
Pros and Cons - Integration and Usage
================================================================================

SX1262 868M LoRa HAT (UART-based Driver)
================================================================================

PROS (Integration & Usage):
---------------------------
1. Simple UART interface - only needs TX, RX, M0, M1 pins (4 pins total)
2. Easy initialization - just set frequency, address, power in constructor
3. Built-in addressing system - automatic message routing by node address
4. Built-in network ID - isolate networks without code changes
5. Simple send/receive API - just call send(target_addr, message) and receive()
6. No LoRa parameter knowledge needed - module handles SF, BW, CR internally
7. Built-in relay mode - mesh networking without extra code
8. Simple encryption - just set encryption key (0-65535)
9. Automatic message formatting - module adds addressing headers automatically
10. Good for rapid prototyping - minimal code to get started

CONS (Integration & Usage):
---------------------------
1. Requires mode switching - must control M0/M1 pins for configuration
2. UART speed limits throughput - max 115200 bps (slower than SPI)
3. Configuration retry needed - may need 2-3 attempts to configure module
4. Fixed air data rates - only 7 options (1200-62500 bps), not continuous
5. Limited power levels - only 4 options (10, 13, 17, 22 dBm)
6. 7-byte message overhead - addressing headers added to every message
7. Proprietary protocol - cannot communicate with standard LoRa devices
8. No interrupt support - must poll UART for received messages
9. Blocking operations only - cannot use callbacks or non-blocking mode
10. Limited debugging - cannot read chip registers or internal state


Core1262-868M (SPI-based Driver)
================================================================================

PROS (Integration & Usage):
---------------------------
1. Direct chip control - full access to SX1262 registers via SPI
2. Internal CRC support - hardware CRC checking, no software overhead
3. Standard LoRa compliance - compatible with other LoRa devices
4. Fine-grained frequency control - any frequency from 150-960 MHz
5. Precise power control - any power level from -9 to 22 dBm
6. Full LoRa parameter control - adjust SF (5-12), BW, CR independently
7. Interrupt-driven operation - IRQ pin for efficient event handling
8. Blocking and non-blocking modes - choose based on application needs
9. Callback function support - register callbacks for TX/RX events
10. Both LoRa and GFSK modulation - switch modulation types at runtime

CONS (Integration & Usage):
---------------------------
1. More pins required - needs SPI (4 pins) + CS, IRQ, RST, GPIO (7 pins total)
2. Complex initialization - must configure many LoRa parameters (SF, BW, CR, etc.)
3. Need LoRa knowledge - must understand spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate
4. Manual addressing - must implement node addressing in application code
5. No built-in routing - must implement mesh/relay logic in application
6. No built-in encryption - must implement encryption at application layer
7. More code complexity - ~2800 lines across 3 files vs ~1100 in single file
8. Parameter validation needed - must ensure valid SF/BW/CR combinations
9. SPI bus conflicts - may conflict with other SPI devices on same bus
10. Steeper learning curve - more concepts to understand before use


Key Differences Summary
