4. **Implement monitoring** - early warning prevents system failures
5. **Document everything** - maintain installation and configuration records

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Undersized battery backup (leads to system shutdowns)
- Poor weatherproofing (causes component failures)
- Inadequate solar panel mounting (wind damage)
- Missing fuses/protection (electrical fires)
- Insufficient ventilation (overheating issues)

This system design provides reliable, autonomous operation for outdoor Raspberry Pi camera applications with minimal maintenance requirements and excellent long-term durability.
