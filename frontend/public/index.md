# Asset Management

This directory (`public/`) is where you should place all static assets and downloaded files used in the application. This includes:

- Images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`, etc.)
- Fonts
- Icons
- Downloaded files
- Other static resources

## Best Practices

1. **Organization**: Create appropriate subdirectories to organize different types of assets (e.g., `images/`, `fonts/`, `icons/`)
2. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for files
3. **Optimization**: Ensure assets are optimized for web use (compressed images, minified files)
4. **Version Control**: Consider using a `.gitignore` for large files or frequently changing assets

## Accessing Assets

Assets placed in this directory can be accessed directly from your application using relative paths. For example:

```html
<img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

or in React:

```jsx
<img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/images/logo.png'} alt="Logo" />
```

Remember that the `public` directory is served at the root of your application, so paths should be relative to this directory.
